[![Framework: Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Vite-646cff.svg)](https://vite.dev/)

A WebXR starter built with the [Immersive Web SDK](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/webxr-iwsdk-overview)
(IWSDK 1.0.0-rc.0), packaged as a template for [v0](https://v0.app/) and deployable to
Vercel as a static Vite app.

## What's included

- **A VR desk scene** — environment, robot, plant, a grabbable demo cube, a
  spatial welcome panel and a controller-input HUD, composed declaratively in
  `public/scenes/main.iwsdk.scene.json`.
- **Controller mapping** — `ControllerInputSystem` maps the right A/B buttons to
  scale, left X to cycle color and left Y to reset, and mirrors live button,
  trigger, grip and thumbstick state onto the HUD panel.
- **Manifest-first project layout** — `iwsdk.config.json` is the single authority
  for the active scene, asset catalog, component catalog, XR mode and world
  features.
- **XR emulation without a headset** — IWER lets any browser enter an emulated
  Quest 3 session on the dev server, including the v0 sandbox preview. See
  [XR emulation](#xr-emulation) for how it is gated.
- **Agent guidance** for v0, Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot, synced from the
  upstream IWSDK guidance in `facebook/immersive-web-sdk`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the
result, then click **Enter XR** to start an emulated immersive session. You can
start editing the scene by modifying `public/scenes/main.iwsdk.scene.json`, or
the systems that drive it under `src/`. The page auto-updates as you edit.

`npm run dev` is plain Vite — the mode v0's sandbox and `vercel dev` expect, and
the one script v0 starts on your behalf. It serves the app and nothing else.

For the full IWSDK authoring loop — the managed browser, the scene editor, and
the MCP command bridge that powers the scene/ECS/XR tooling — use the managed
server instead:

```bash
npm run dev:managed   # iwsdk dev up --open --foreground
npm run dev:status
npm run dev:down
```

Run only one of the two at a time: `npm run dev:down` first if a plain Vite
server already holds the port.

Optional one-time setup for the semantic code-reference MCP tools:

```sh
npm run reference:warmup
```

Before testing anything, typecheck. Type errors stop systems from initialising
without necessarily logging to the console:

```sh
npm run typecheck
```

## Project structure

```
iwsdk.config.json                 project authority: scene, assets, components, world, dev
vercel.json                       framework, output directory and SPA rewrite
src/
  index.ts                        World.create() + explicit system registration
  assets.ts                       defineAssets() — catalog shared by runtime and editor
  components.ts                   defineComponents() — catalog shared by runtime and editor
  robot-component.ts              Robot tag component
  robot.ts                        RobotSystem — look-at behavior and click audio
  demo-cube-component.ts          DemoCube tag component and its color palette
  input.ts                        ControllerInputSystem — face buttons and HUD mirroring
  panel.ts                        PanelSystem — Enter XR / Exit to Browser wiring
  scene-assets/                   *.scene-asset.ts — parentless Object3D prototypes
public/
  scenes/main.iwsdk.scene.json    composition only — manifest IDs, transforms, components
  ui/*.uikitml                    runtime-loaded panels
  gltf/ audio/ textures/          static assets
```

Composition lives in JSON; geometry, materials and URLs live in TypeScript. Scene
JSON references assets only by manifest ID.

## Using this template in v0

Open the repository in [v0](https://v0.app/) and it runs in a Vercel Sandbox: a
real Node.js VM with a framework-aware dev server, a terminal and Claude Code
pre-installed. v0 detects Vite, starts `npm run dev` itself, and proxies the
result through a generated HTTPS hostname — a secure context, which is what
WebXR requires.

To point a fresh chat at your own copy, fork this repository and give v0 the fork
URL. Agent guidance is already wired up: `AGENTS.md` at the root, path-scoped
detail in `src/AGENTS.md`, `public/ui/AGENTS.md` and `public/scenes/AGENTS.md`,
and skill procedures under `.claude/skills/` mirrored into `.agents/skills/`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is to import the repository into
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), or run `vercel` from the project root.

`vercel.json` selects the Vite framework preset, builds to `dist/`, sends
`Permissions-Policy: xr-spatial-tracking=*` so WebXR is allowed, and rewrites
unmatched paths to `/index.html`. Static files under `public/` still win, because
Vercel checks the filesystem before applying rewrites.

WebXR requires a secure context. The deployed HTTPS URL and `http://localhost`
both qualify; a plain-HTTP LAN address does not. To test on a physical headset
against your dev machine, run `IWSDK_DEV_HTTPS=1 npm run dev` and accept the
self-signed certificate on the device.

To deploy under a subpath, set `VITE_BASE_PATH` at build time.

## XR emulation

IWER is not part of the app bundle by default — `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-dev` injects
it, and two separate gates decide whether it reaches the page. Both are set in
`iwsdk.config.json` under `dev.emulator`, which is the project authority for this;
the plugin rejects the same options passed to `iwsdkDev()` in `vite.config.ts`.

| Gate            | Default     | Effect of the default                                            |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `injectOnBuild` | `false`     | `vite build` emits no emulator, so deploys have nothing to run   |
| `activation`    | `localhost` | the injected runtime stays inert on any non-localhost hostname   |

The default `activation` is the one that bites in practice: the dev server always
injects IWER, but a v0 preview is served from a generated `*.v0.build` hostname
(older sandboxes used `*.vusercontent.net`), so the runtime loads and then sits
inert. This template widens `activation` to cover the hostnames a preview
actually uses:

```jsonc
"dev": {
  "emulator": {
    "device": "metaQuest3",
    "activation": {
      "source": "^(localhost|127\\.0\\.0\\.1|.*\\.vercel\\.app|.*\\.vusercontent\\.net|.*\\.v0\\.build)$"
    }
  }
}
```

The pattern is matched against `location.hostname` alone — no scheme, port or
path — so each term is a bare host suffix. v0 has renamed its preview domain
before; if it happens again, add a term here rather than widening to `.*`.

A regex is an object here (`{ source, flags }`), not a `/.../` string. On a real
headset IWER steps aside regardless, via the default `userAgentException` of
`/OculusBrowser/`.

`injectOnBuild` is deliberately left at its default. Emulating a headset is a
development affordance, and injecting the runtime adds roughly 1 MB to the
production bundle — a cost every visitor pays, including on domains where
`activation` returns false. The consequence is that **a deployed build ships no
emulator**: `npm run dev` and the v0 sandbox get IWER, a `vercel deploy` does
not. Set `injectOnBuild: true` if you want deploys emulated too; the
`.vercel.app` term in `activation` is there for that case and is otherwise inert.

## Notes

- Import Three.js classes from `@iwsdk/core`, never from `three` — a direct
  `three` import creates a duplicate instance and subtle breakage.
- `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-dev` depends on Playwright, so the first `npm install` in a
  fresh sandbox downloads Chromium. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` to
  skip it when you only need to build — CI does exactly that.
- `package-lock.json` is committed, so `npm ci` reproduces the dependency tree
  exactly. Regenerate it with `npm install` whenever you change `package.json`.
